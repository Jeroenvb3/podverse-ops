NOTE: Adding the BitPay API key to a container is a manual process (unfortunately). After you first create a podverse-api container, you will need to ssh into the running container, then follow the instructions found at https://github.com/bitpay/node-bitpay-client to create the api.key and pair it, then restart the container to use the new key.
